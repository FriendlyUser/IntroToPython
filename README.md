How to create, manipulate and access data using variables, literals, constants and operators
How to use basic input and output functions such as print() and input()
Chapter 3: Control flow and functions
How to use conditional statements such as if-elif-else to make decisions based on conditions
How to use looping statements such as for and while to repeat actions based on conditions or sequences
How to use break, continue and pass statements to control the flow of loops
How to define and call functions using def keyword and parameters

Chapter 4: Modules and packages
What are modules and packages in Python and how they help organize code into reusable units
How to import modules and packages using import statement or from-import statement
How to use some of the standard library modules such as math, random, datetime etc.
How to create your own modules and packages using init.py file
Chapter 5: Object-oriented programming
Some additional sentences for chapter five are:

What are objects in Python and how they represent real-world entities with attributes (data) and methods (behavior)
What are classes in Python and how they define the blueprint for creating objects
How to create classes using class keyword and init method
How to instantiate objects from classes using constructor method
How to access attributes (using dot notation) or methods (using parentheses) of objects

Chapter 6: Exceptions and errors
What are exceptions and errors in Python and how they indicate problems or abnormal situations in the program
How to handle exceptions using try-except-finally blocks
How to raise exceptions using raise statement or assert statement
How to use some of the built-in exceptions such as ValueError, IndexError, KeyError etc.
How to create your own custom exceptions using class inheritance
Chapter 7: File handling and data processing
How to work with files in Python using open(), close(), read(), write() and other methods
How to use different modes such as ‘r’, ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘b’ etc. to open files for reading, writing or appending
How to use context managers using with statement to automatically close files
How to process data from files using loops, string methods, regular expressions etc.
How to use some of the built-in modules such as csv, json, xml etc. to read and write data in different formats
Chapter 8: Functional programming
What is functional programming and how it differs from imperative or object-oriented programming
The advantages and disadvantages of functional programming such as purity, immutability, higher-order functions etc.
How to use some of the built-in functions in Python such as map(), filter(), reduce(), lambda etc. to apply functions on iterables
How to use list comprehensions, set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions to create new collections from existing ones
How to use generators and generator expressions to create lazy iterables that can be consumed on demand
Chapter 9: Web development with Python
Some additional sentences for chapter nine are:
