## Plots in matplotlib

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
labels = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June']
values = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

# Create a bar chart
plt.bar(labels, values)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Monthly Sales')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')

# Display the chart
plt.show()
```
This code creates a simple bar chart with monthly sales data. The `labels` list contains the names of each month, while the `values` list contains the sales figures for each month.

The `plt.bar()` function is used to create the bar chart. It takes two arguments: the `labels` list and the `values` list.

The `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` functions are used to add a title and labels to the chart.

Finally, the `plt.show()` function is called to display the chart.


Sure, here's an example of how to plot a sample dataframe using pandas:


```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = {'year': [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020],
 'sales': [1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000],
 'expenses': [800, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800]}

# Create a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plot the data
df.plot(x='year', y=['sales', 'expenses'], kind='bar')

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Sales and Expenses by Year')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Amount ($)')

# Display the chart
plt.show()
```
This code creates a pandas DataFrame with two columns (`sales` and `expenses`) and five rows, each representing a year from 2016 to 2020.

The `df.plot()` function is used to create a bar chart of the `sales` and `expenses` columns, with the `year` column used as the x-axis. The `kind` argument is set to `'bar'` to create a bar chart.

The `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` functions are used to add a title and labels to the chart.

Finally, the `plt.show()` function is called to display the chart.


Sure, here's an example of how to use the `requests` library to get data from an API and load it into a pandas DataFrame:


```{code-cell} ipython3
import requests
import pandas as pd

# API endpoint
url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'

# Make a GET request to the API endpoint
response = requests.get(url)

# Convert the response to a JSON object
data = response.json()

# Create a pandas DataFrame from the JSON object
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
```
This code makes a GET request to an API endpoint and stores the response in the `response` variable.

The `response.json()` method is used to convert the response to a JSON object.

The JSON object is then passed to the `pd.DataFrame()` function to create a pandas DataFrame.

Finally, the `df.head()` method is used to display the first five rows of the DataFrame.

Note that the specific API endpoint used in this example returns a list of posts, each with a `userId`, `id`, `title`, and `body` field. Depending on the API you're using, you may need to adjust the code to match the format of the data returned by the API.


## Web Scrapping with bs4 and pandas


Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It is a powerful tool for handling structured data, such as spreadsheets and SQL tables. One of the most useful features of pandas is its ability to read and write data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.

Pandas can also be used for web scraping by reading data from HTML tables on web pages. The library provides a method called `read_html()` that can parse HTML tables and return a list of data frames. Data frames are two-dimensional tables with labeled rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets.

Here's an example code snippet that uses pandas to scrape a table from a web page:


```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the web page containing the table
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Read the HTML table into a list of data frames
dfs = pd.read_html(url)

# Extract the first data frame (assuming only one table on the page)
df = dfs[0]

# Print the first 5 rows of the data frame
print(df.head())
```
In this code snippet, we first import the pandas library using the `import` statement. We then specify the URL of the web page containing the table we want to scrape. We use the `pd.read_html()` method to read the HTML table into a list of data frames. Since `read_html()` can potentially return multiple data frames (if there are multiple tables on the page), we extract the first data frame using the index `[0]`. Finally, we print the first 5 rows of the data frame using the `head()` method.

Note that `read_html()` can handle some simple HTML tables, but may not work with more complex tables or tables that are embedded within other elements on the page. In such cases, we may need to use other web scraping techniques or libraries.

Overall, pandas is a powerful tool for web scraping and data analysis, and can save us a lot of time and effort when working with structured data on the web.


Beautiful Soup (bs4) is a Python library used for web scraping. It allows us to parse HTML and XML documents and extract information from them. One common use case for bs4 is to scrape data from tables on web pages.

To extract the data from a table using bs4, we first need to obtain the HTML source code of the web page containing the table. We can do this using the `requests` library, which allows us to make HTTP requests to web pages and retrieve their HTML content. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to get the HTML source code of a web page:


```python
import requests

# URL of the web page we want to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Make a GET request to the URL and get the HTML content
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.content

# Print the HTML content
print(html_content)
```
In this code snippet, we first import the `requests` library using the `import` statement. We then specify the URL of the web page we want to scrape. We use the `requests.get()` method to make a GET request to the URL and retrieve the HTML content. We store the content in a variable called `html_content` and print it to the console.

Once we have the HTML source code of the web page, we can use bs4 to extract the table data. We start by creating a BeautifulSoup object and passing in the HTML content. We can then use the `find()` or `find_all()` methods to locate the table element(s) and extract their data. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to extract the data from a table using bs4:


```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Create a BeautifulSoup object and pass in the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

# Find the first table element on the page
table = soup.find('table')

# Loop through the rows of the table and extract the data
for row in table.find_all('tr'):
 # Extract the data from each cell in the row
 cells = row.find_all('td')
 data = [cell.text.strip() for cell in cells]
 
 # Print the data for this row
 print(data)
```
In this code snippet, we first import the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` library. We create a `soup` object by passing in the HTML content and specifying the parser to use (in this case, the built-in `html.parser`).

We then use the `soup.find()` method to find the first `table` element on the page. We can use the `find_all()` method to find all table elements on the page.

Next, we loop through the rows of the table using the `find_all('tr')` method. For each row, we extract the data from each cell using the `find_all('td')` method, which finds all `td` elements in the row. We then use a list comprehension to extract the text content of each cell and strip any whitespace using the `text.strip()` method.

Finally, we print the data for each row to the console. Note that this code snippet assumes that the table contains only text data. If the table contains other types of elements, such as links or images, we may need to modify the code to handle those cases.

Overall, bs4 is a powerful tool for web scraping, and can save us a lot of time and effort when working with HTML documents.


Pandas is a popular Python library for data analysis, manipulation, and cleaning. It is often used in data science projects, including web scraping, to process and analyze data in a tabular format.

To parse a table using pandas, we first need to obtain the HTML source code of the web page containing the table. We can do this using the `requests` library, as shown in the previous example. Once we have the HTML source code, we can use the `read_html()` method provided by pandas to parse the table data. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to extract the data from a table using pandas:


```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the web page we want to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Use pandas to read the table data from the URL
tables = pd.read_html(url)

# Print the first table
print(tables[0])
```
In this code snippet, we first import the `pandas` library using the `import` statement. We then specify the URL of the web page we want to scrape. We use the `pd.read_html()` method to read the table data from the URL and store the result in a variable called `tables`. This method returns a list of DataFrame objects, one for each table on the page.

In this example, we assume that the page contains only one table, so we print the first table using `print(tables[0])`. If the page contains multiple tables, we can print each table by looping through the list of DataFrame objects.

Pandas also provides several methods for manipulating and cleaning the data in the DataFrame objects. For example, we can use the `drop()` method to remove columns or rows with missing data, the `fillna()` method to fill in missing data with a default value, or the `merge()` method to combine multiple DataFrame objects into a single object.

Overall, pandas is a powerful tool for working with tabular data and can simplify the process of extracting and processing data from web pages.


Once we have parsed the table using pandas, we can easily output it to a CSV (comma-separated values) file using the `to_csv()` method provided by pandas. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to output the table to a CSV file:


```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the web page we want to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Use pandas to read the table data from the URL
tables = pd.read_html(url)

# Get the first table from the list
df = tables[0]

# Output the table to a CSV file
df.to_csv('table.csv', index=False)
```
In this code snippet, we first import the `pandas` library using the `import` statement. We then specify the URL of the web page we want to scrape and use `pd.read_html()` to read the table data from the URL and store it in the `tables` variable.

Next, we get the first table from the `tables` list and store it in a variable called `df`. We then use the `to_csv()` method to output the table to a CSV file called `table.csv`. The `index=False` parameter tells pandas not to include the row index numbers in the output file.

Once the code is executed, a CSV file called `table.csv` will be created in the current working directory with the data from the table. We can open this file in any spreadsheet application, such as Excel or Google Sheets, to view and manipulate the data further.

Overall, pandas makes it easy to output table data to a variety of file formats, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases. This flexibility makes it a popular choice for data scientists and analysts who need to work with data from a variety of sources.


Pandas is a powerful library that provides many advanced features for cleaning and manipulating data. In this section, we'll explore some of these features that can be used to clean the data extracted from a website.

1. Removing Duplicates:
Sometimes a web page might have duplicate rows in its table, which can cause problems in our data analysis. Pandas provides a `drop_duplicates()` method to remove duplicate rows from a DataFrame. Here's an example code snippet:


```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the web page we want to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Use pandas to read the table data from the URL
tables = pd.read_html(url)

# Get the first table from the list
df = tables[0]

# Drop duplicate rows
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```
In this example, we first parse the table using pandas and get the first table from the list of DataFrame objects. We then use the `drop_duplicates()` method to remove any duplicate rows in the table. The `inplace=True` parameter tells pandas to modify the DataFrame in place rather than returning a new DataFrame object.

2. Renaming Columns:
The column names in a table might not always be in a format that's suitable for our data analysis. Pandas provides a `rename()` method to change the column names of a DataFrame. Here's an example code snippet:


```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the web page we want to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Use pandas to read the table data from the URL
tables = pd.read_html(url)

# Get the first table from the list
df = tables[0]

# Rename the columns
df = df.rename(columns={'old\_column\_name': 'new\_column\_name'})
```
In this example, we first parse the table using pandas and get the first table from the list of DataFrame objects. We then use the `rename()` method to change the name of a specific column in the DataFrame. The `{'old_column_name': 'new_column_name'}` parameter tells pandas to replace the old column name with the new column name.

3. Dealing with Missing Values:
Web pages might have missing data in their tables, which can cause problems in our data analysis. Pandas provides several methods for dealing with missing values, including the `dropna()` and `fillna()` methods.

The `dropna()` method removes any rows or columns with missing values from a DataFrame, while the `fillna()` method fills in the missing values with a default value or a value calculated from the other data in the DataFrame.

Here's an example code snippet:


```python
import pandas as pd

# URL of the web page we want to scrape
url = 'https://www.example.com/table.html'

# Use pandas to read the table data from the URL
tables = pd.read_html(url)

# Get the first table from the list
df = tables[0]

# Remove rows with missing data
df = df.dropna()

# Fill in missing data with a default value
df = df.fillna(0)
```
In this example, we first parse the table using pandas and get the first table from the list of DataFrame objects. We then use the `dropna()` method to remove any rows with missing data from the DataFrame. We then use the `fillna()` method to fill in any remaining missing data with the value 0.

Overall, pandas provides a wide range of features for cleaning and manipulating data, which makes it a popular choice for data scientists and analysts. By using these advanced features, we can transform raw data extracted from a website into a format that's suitable for our data analysis.


## Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are interactive computing environments that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They are widely used in data science, scientific computing, and education, among other fields.

At its core, a Jupyter notebook consists of a JSON file that contains a set of cells. Each cell can contain code, markdown, or raw text. Code cells allow you to write and execute code interactively, while markdown cells allow you to write formatted text using the Markdown syntax. Raw text cells allow you to write plain text that will be included in the notebook as-is.

When you create a new Jupyter notebook, you are presented with an interface that allows you to create, edit, and run cells. The interface is typically divided into two main areas: the notebook toolbar and the notebook cells.

The notebook toolbar contains various options for working with the notebook, such as creating new cells, saving the notebook, and changing the notebook's kernel. The kernel is the computational engine that executes the code in the notebook. By default, Jupyter notebooks use a Python kernel, but you can also use kernels for other languages such as R and Julia.

The notebook cells are where you write and run code. Each cell can be executed independently of the others, allowing you to test and iterate on your code. When you run a code cell, the kernel executes the code and returns the output below the cell. This output can include text, tables, charts, and other visualizations.

One of the main advantages of Jupyter notebooks is that they allow you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document. This makes it easy to create and share reproducible analyses and reports, as well as interactive tutorials and educational materials.

In addition, Jupyter notebooks are highly extensible, with a large ecosystem of plugins and extensions that allow you to customize the user interface, add new functionality, and integrate with other tools and services.

Overall, Jupyter notebooks provide a powerful and flexible environment for interactive computing, data analysis, and scientific communication. Whether you're a data scientist, a researcher, or an educator, Jupyter notebooks can help you work more efficiently and collaborate more effectively.
