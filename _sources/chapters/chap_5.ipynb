    "# Chapter 5: Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (referred to as \"attributes\" or \"properties\") and methods (referred to as \"behaviors\" or \"functions\") that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind OOP is to model real-world entities as objects in the program. For example, in a car racing game, we might create an object for each car that contains attributes such as its speed, position, and direction, as well as methods for accelerating, braking, and turning. We might also create objects for the race track, the obstacles on the track, and the other drivers in the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "By modeling real-world entities as objects in the program, we can create a more intuitive and natural representation of the problem domain. We can also encapsulate data and behavior within objects, which helps to reduce complexity and make the code more modular and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, objects are usually defined using classes, which are templates or blueprints for creating objects of a certain type. For example, we might define a `Car` class that contains the attributes and methods for a car object. We can then create multiple car objects from this class, each with its own set of attribute values.\n",
