## Image magick
ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. ImageMagick is used to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polyglines, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.

It is used by graphic designers, photographers, scientists and also used for creating thumbnails for websites, creating GIF animations, converting PDF pages to images and so on. ImageMagick can be used from the command-line or can be used as a programming library for software development.


You can call ImageMagick from Python using the `os` module, which provides a way to interface with the underlying operating system.

Here's an example of how to use ImageMagick to convert an image from one format to another:


```python
import os

input_image = 'input.jpg'
output_image = 'output.png'

os.system(f'convert {input_image} {output_image}')
```
In this example, `convert` is the command-line utility provided by ImageMagick to convert images. The `input_image` variable specifies the path to the input image and `output_image` specifies the path to the output image. The `os.system` function is used to run the `convert` command, which converts the input image to the output image.

The convert utility is only available in imagemagick 6.

Note that this method is prone to security vulnerabilities, since it passes the parameters directly to the shell. To avoid these vulnerabilities, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides a more secure way of calling shell commands. Here's an example of how to use the `subprocess` module to call ImageMagick:


```python
import subprocess

input_image = 'input.jpg'
output_image = 'output.png'

subprocess.run(['convert', input_image, output_image])
```
In this example, the `subprocess.run` function is used to run the `convert` command, and the parameters are passed as a list, rather than as a string. This is a more secure way of calling shell commands, as it avoids shell injection attacks.

```python
import os

def main():
    dir_list =  os.listdir('.')
    for full_file_name in dir_list:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(full_file_name)
        if extension == '.pdf': # then .pdf file --> convert to image!
            cmd_str = ' '.join(['convert',
                                '-density 400',
                                full_file_name,
                                '-flatten',
                                base_name + '.png'])
            print(cmd_str)  # echo command to terminal
            os.system(cmd_str)  # execute command

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This is a Python script that uses the os module to convert all PDF files in the current directory to PNG images using ImageMagick. The main function lists all the files in the current directory using os.listdir, and then loops through each file name in dir_list. If the file extension is '.pdf', the script splits the file name into its base name and extension using os.path.splitext, and then creates a command string using cmd_str that calls ImageMagick's convert utility with the specified options.

The options used in this script are:

- density 400: sets the density of the output image, which affects its resolution.
- flatten: combines all the layers of the PDF into a single image.

The os.system function is then used to execute the command string, which converts the PDF file to a PNG image. The script prints the command string to the terminal to show what it's doing, and the result is a set of PNG images, one for each PDF file in the directory.

ImageMagick is a versatile and powerful software suite that has many uses, including:

1. Image Conversion: ImageMagick can be used to convert images from one format to another, making it easier to work with different image formats.
2. Image Editing: ImageMagick can be used to perform basic image editing operations, such as cropping, resizing, rotating, and flipping images.
3. Image Compression: ImageMagick can be used to compress images, reducing their file size while maintaining image quality.
4. Image Manipulation: ImageMagick can be used to manipulate images in various ways, such as applying special effects, adding text and shapes, and blending multiple images together.
5. Thumbnail Creation: ImageMagick can be used to create thumbnails for websites, making it easier to manage large numbers of images.
6. Image Animation: ImageMagick can be used to create GIF animations from a sequence of images.
7. PDF Conversion: ImageMagick can be used to convert PDF pages to images, making it easier to work with PDF documents.
8. Image Processing: ImageMagick can be used for image processing tasks, such as adjusting image colors and removing noise from images.
9. Scientific Visualization: ImageMagick can be used in scientific visualization, such as for rendering 3D models or visualizing data.

These are just a few examples of the many uses of ImageMagick. It is a highly versatile software suite that can be used in many different ways to work with images.

This is a Python script that uses the ChatGPT API, the pyChatGPT library, and the stability\_sdk to generate text and images. The script takes in a configuration file in YAML format, which specifies the input text, the output file, and various settings such as the programming language to use for code blocks and the prompt for the image generation.
It uses the ChatGPT API to generate text in response to prompts specified in the configuration file. The script also uses the stability\_sdk to generate images based on the prompt specified in the configuration file. The script also uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to save the generated images to a directory. Additionally, it processes the generated text, using regular expressions to replace plain backticks with code blocks in the specified programming language.

This code is a Python script that downloads documents from the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) website and makes a Discord request with the document URL and summary. Here's a brief overview of what it does:

1. It retrieves a list of documents from the CSE website using the `get_recent_docs_from_url` function.
2. For each document, it retrieves the document URL.
3. If the document URL is not already in a CSV file, it adds it to the CSV file.
4. It downloads the document and saves it to a directory called `docs`.
5. For each document URL, it makes a Discord request with the document URL.
6. For each document URL, it makes another Discord request with the document summary.

The Discord request is sent using the `requests` library. The `make_discord_request` function takes in several arguments, including the content, embeds, filename, and file data. If the filename and file data are provided, the function makes a request with the file attached. If the embeds argument is provided, the function makes a request with the embeds data. The URL for the Discord webhook is read from an environment variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`.


```python 
 
stockList = ["PKK", "IDK", "ADDC", "VPH", "VST", "ACT"]
def get_cse_tickers_data():
    url = "https://github.com/FriendlyUser/cad_tickers_list/blob/main/static/latest/cse.csv?raw=true"
    r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
    s = r.content
    return pd.read_csv(StringIO(s.decode('utf-8')))

stock_df = get_cse_tickers_data()
stock_rows = stock_df.loc[stock_df['Symbol'].isin(stockList)]
stock_rows.loc[:, 'stock'] = stock_rows['Symbol']
stock_rows.loc[:, 'url'] = stock_rows['urls']
stockUrls = stock_rows.to_dict('records')
csv_file = "docs.csv"
if os.path.isfile(csv_file):
    # read from csv
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
else:
    # make new df
    df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["stock", "url", "docUrl"])
 
 ```

This code is retrieving data for a list of stocks (`stockList`) from the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE). It uses the `get_cse_tickers_data` function to retrieve the data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub, which contains information about CSE stocks, such as their symbol, name, and URLs. The function uses the `requests` library to make a GET request to the URL of the CSV file, and the returned content is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv`.

Next, the code filters the data for only the stocks in the `stockList` by using the `loc` method on the DataFrame and checking if the value in the `Symbol` column is in the `stockList` using the `isin` method. The filtered data is then saved in the `stock_rows` DataFrame.

The code then creates two new columns in the `stock_rows` DataFrame, one named `stock` and the other named `url`, which contain the values from the `Symbol` and `urls` columns, respectively. The filtered data is then converted into a list of dictionaries (`stockUrls`) using the `to_dict` method.

Finally, the code checks if there is an existing CSV file named `docs.csv` in the current directory. If there is, it reads the data into a DataFrame using `pd.

    stockName = stock.get("stock")

This code is a script that downloads and summarizes recent documents from a list of stock symbols. The stock symbols are stored in the list `stockList`, and the data for these symbols is obtained by calling the `get_cse_tickers_data` function, which retrieves data from a CSV file stored on GitHub.

The code then loops through each of the stocks in `stockList`, and for each stock, it retrieves a list of recent documents by calling the `get_recent_docs_from_url` function and passing it the URL for the stock.

For each document, the code checks if the document URL already exists in the DataFrame `df`. If the URL does not exist, the code adds the document information (i.e., stock name, URL, and a summary) to `df` and makes a Discord request to post the information to a Discord channel. The information posted to the Discord channel includes the stock name, document URL, and a summary of the document's contents. If the contents of the document are available, they are also included in the Discord request as an attachment.

After all the documents have been processed, the code removes any duplicates in `df` and sorts the entries by the stock name. Finally, the updated `df` is saved to a CSV file.
