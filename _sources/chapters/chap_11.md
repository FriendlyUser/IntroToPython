## Using argparse


argparse is a Python module that makes it easy to write command-line interfaces. It allows you to specify the arguments that your program should accept in a clean and organized way, and it takes care of handling the input and output for you.

Here's an example of how to use argparse to parse command-line arguments in a Python script:


```python
argparse is a Python module that makes it easy to write command-line interfaces. It allows you to specify the arguments that your program should accept in a clean and organized way, and it takes care of handling the input and output for you.

Here's an example of how to use argparse to parse command-line arguments in a Python script:
```

This script defines a single command-line argument, --sum, which specifies whether the program should sum or find the maximum of the integers. If the --sum argument is not provided, the default action is to find the maximum.

To run this script, you would type something like python script.py 1 2 3 --sum at the command line. This would cause the script to print 6, which is the sum of the integers 1, 2, and 3.

Here's an example of how you might use argparse to write a command-line interface for a program that keeps track of the books that a bear has read:

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Bear book tracker')

# Add a command to add a book to the bear's reading list
parser.add_argument('--add', dest='book', type=str,
                    help='add a book to the reading list')

# Add a command to list the books that the bear has read
parser.add_argument('--list', action='store_true',
                    help='list the books that the bear has read')

# Parse the arguments
args = parser.parse_args()

# Initialize an empty list to store the bear's books
books = []

# If the --add argument was provided, add the book to the list
if args.book:
    books.append(args.book)

# If the --list argument was provided, print the list of books
if args.list:
    print("Bear's books:")
    for book in books:
        print(book)

```

To use this program, you would type something like python book_tracker.py --add "The Giving Tree" to add a book to the bear's reading list, or python book_tracker.py --list to view the list of books.

I hope this helps give you a basic understanding of how argparse works!

## Convert pdf to pngs
ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. ImageMagick is used to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polyglines, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.

It is used by graphic designers, photographers, scientists and also used for creating thumbnails for websites, creating GIF animations, converting PDF pages to images and so on. ImageMagick can be used from the command-line or can be used as a programming library for software development.


You can call ImageMagick from Python using the `os` module, which provides a way to interface with the underlying operating system.

Here's an example of how to use ImageMagick to convert an image from one format to another:


```python
import os

input_image = 'input.jpg'
output_image = 'output.png'

os.system(f'convert {input_image} {output_image}')
```
In this example, `convert` is the command-line utility provided by ImageMagick to convert images. The `input_image` variable specifies the path to the input image and `output_image` specifies the path to the output image. The `os.system` function is used to run the `convert` command, which converts the input image to the output image.

The convert utility is only available in imagemagick 6.

Note that this method is prone to security vulnerabilities, since it passes the parameters directly to the shell. To avoid these vulnerabilities, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides a more secure way of calling shell commands. Here's an example of how to use the `subprocess` module to call ImageMagick:


```python
import subprocess

input_image = 'input.jpg'
output_image = 'output.png'

subprocess.run(['convert', input_image, output_image])
```
In this example, the `subprocess.run` function is used to run the `convert` command, and the parameters are passed as a list, rather than as a string. This is a more secure way of calling shell commands, as it avoids shell injection attacks.

```

```python
import os

def main():
    dir_list =  os.listdir('.')
    for full_file_name in dir_list:
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(full_file_name)
        if extension == '.pdf': # then .pdf file --> convert to image!
            cmd_str = ' '.join(['convert',
                                '-density 400',
                                full_file_name,
                                '-flatten',
                                base_name + '.png'])
            print(cmd_str)  # echo command to terminal
            os.system(cmd_str)  # execute command

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This is a Python script that uses the os module to convert all PDF files in the current directory to PNG images using ImageMagick. The main function lists all the files in the current directory using os.listdir, and then loops through each file name in dir_list. If the file extension is '.pdf', the script splits the file name into its base name and extension using os.path.splitext, and then creates a command string using cmd_str that calls ImageMagick's convert utility with the specified options.

The options used in this script are:

- density 400: sets the density of the output image, which affects its resolution.
- flatten: combines all the layers of the PDF into a single image.

The os.system function is then used to execute the command string, which converts the PDF file to a PNG image. The script prints the command string to the terminal to show what it's doing, and the result is a set of PNG images, one for each PDF file in the directory.

ImageMagick is a versatile and powerful software suite that has many uses, including:

1. Image Conversion: ImageMagick can be used to convert images from one format to another, making it easier to work with different image formats.
2. Image Editing: ImageMagick can be used to perform basic image editing operations, such as cropping, resizing, rotating, and flipping images.
3. Image Compression: ImageMagick can be used to compress images, reducing their file size while maintaining image quality.
4. Image Manipulation: ImageMagick can be used to manipulate images in various ways, such as applying special effects, adding text and shapes, and blending multiple images together.
5. Thumbnail Creation: ImageMagick can be used to create thumbnails for websites, making it easier to manage large numbers of images.
6. Image Animation: ImageMagick can be used to create GIF animations from a sequence of images.
7. PDF Conversion: ImageMagick can be used to convert PDF pages to images, making it easier to work with PDF documents.
8. Image Processing: ImageMagick can be used for image processing tasks, such as adjusting image colors and removing noise from images.
9. Scientific Visualization: ImageMagick can be used in scientific visualization, such as for rendering 3D models or visualizing data.

These are just a few examples of the many uses of ImageMagick. It is a highly versatile software suite that can be used in many different ways to work with images.

This is a Python script that uses the ChatGPT API, the pyChatGPT library, and the stability\_sdk to generate text and images. The script takes in a configuration file in YAML format, which specifies the input text, the output file, and various settings such as the programming language to use for code blocks and the prompt for the image generation.
It uses the ChatGPT API to generate text in response to prompts specified in the configuration file. The script also uses the stability\_sdk to generate images based on the prompt specified in the configuration file. The script also uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to save the generated images to a directory. Additionally, it processes the generated text, using regular expressions to replace plain backticks with code blocks in the specified programming language.

This code is a Python script that downloads documents from the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) website and makes a Discord request with the document URL and summary. Here's a brief overview of what it does:

1. It retrieves a list of documents from the CSE website using the `get_recent_docs_from_url` function.
2. For each document, it retrieves the document URL.
3. If the document URL is not already in a CSV file, it adds it to the CSV file.
4. It downloads the document and saves it to a directory called `docs`.
5. For each document URL, it makes a Discord request with the document URL.
6. For each document URL, it makes another Discord request with the document summary.

The Discord request is sent using the `requests` library. The `make_discord_request` function takes in several arguments, including the content, embeds, filename, and file data. If the filename and file data are provided, the function makes a request with the file attached. If the embeds argument is provided, the function makes a request with the embeds data. The URL for the Discord webhook is read from an environment variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`.


```python 
 
stockList = ["PKK", "IDK", "ADDC", "VPH", "VST", "ACT"]
def get_cse_tickers_data():
    url = "https://github.com/FriendlyUser/cad_tickers_list/blob/main/static/latest/cse.csv?raw=true"
    r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
    s = r.content
    return pd.read_csv(StringIO(s.decode('utf-8')))

stock_df = get_cse_tickers_data()
stock_rows = stock_df.loc[stock_df['Symbol'].isin(stockList)]
stock_rows.loc[:, 'stock'] = stock_rows['Symbol']
stock_rows.loc[:, 'url'] = stock_rows['urls']
stockUrls = stock_rows.to_dict('records')
csv_file = "docs.csv"
if os.path.isfile(csv_file):
    # read from csv
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
else:
    # make new df
    df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["stock", "url", "docUrl"])
 
 ```

This code is retrieving data for a list of stocks (`stockList`) from the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE). It uses the `get_cse_tickers_data` function to retrieve the data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub, which contains information about CSE stocks, such as their symbol, name, and URLs. The function uses the `requests` library to make a GET request to the URL of the CSV file, and the returned content is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv`.

Next, the code filters the data for only the stocks in the `stockList` by using the `loc` method on the DataFrame and checking if the value in the `Symbol` column is in the `stockList` using the `isin` method. The filtered data is then saved in the `stock_rows` DataFrame.

The code then creates two new columns in the `stock_rows` DataFrame, one named `stock` and the other named `url`, which contain the values from the `Symbol` and `urls` columns, respectively. The filtered data is then converted into a list of dictionaries (`stockUrls`) using the `to_dict` method.

Finally, the code checks if there is an existing CSV file named `docs.csv` in the current directory. If there is, it reads the data into a DataFrame using `pd.

 for stock in stockUrls:
    stockName = stock.get("stock")

df = df.drop_duplicates()
df = df.sort_values(by=['stock'])
df.to_csv(csv_file, index=False) 
 ```

This code is a script that downloads and summarizes recent documents from a list of stock symbols. The stock symbols are stored in the list `stockList`, and the data for these symbols is obtained by calling the `get_cse_tickers_data` function, which retrieves data from a CSV file stored on GitHub.

The code then loops through each of the stocks in `stockList`, and for each stock, it retrieves a list of recent documents by calling the `get_recent_docs_from_url` function and passing it the URL for the stock.

For each document, the code checks if the document URL already exists in the DataFrame `df`. If the URL does not exist, the code adds the document information (i.e., stock name, URL, and a summary) to `df` and makes a Discord request to post the information to a Discord channel. The information posted to the Discord channel includes the stock name, document URL, and a summary of the document's contents. If the contents of the document are available, they are also included in the Discord request as an attachment.

After all the documents have been processed, the code removes any duplicates in `df` and sorts the entries by the stock name. Finally, the updated `df` is saved to a CSV file.

## Generate Subtitles for Youtube Videos
Transcribing videos is important for several reasons. Firstly, it makes the content of the video more accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Secondly, it can improve search engine optimization (SEO) as the text in the transcription can be indexed by search engines. Thirdly, it can make it easier to create captions or subtitles for the video, which can again make it more accessible to a wider audience. Finally, transcribing videos can be useful for researchers or content creators who want to analyze the content of the video or repurpose it in other ways.

    return {
        "selected_id": selected_id,
        "is_livestream": is_livestream,
    } 
 ```

The above code is written in Python and contains functions for getting metadata for a YouTube video, parsing the metadata, and converting seconds to timecode. It also imports the necessary libraries including `whisper`, `gradio`, `ffmpeg`, `yt_dlp`, `os`, `sys`, and `subprocess`.

The `get_video_metadata` function takes a YouTube video URL as input and returns a dictionary containing metadata about the video such as the title and uploader ID. This function uses the `YoutubeDL` library to extract information about the video from YouTube.

The `parse_metadata` function takes the metadata dictionary as input and returns a dictionary containing the selected video format ID and a boolean indicating whether the video is a livestream or not. This function filters the available video formats to only include MP4 formats and then selects the video format with the highest priority (based on the priority list `youtube_mp4_codes`). If no MP4 format is available, it selects the first available format.

The `second_to_timecode` function takes a floating-point number representing a time in seconds as input and returns a string formatted as `hh:mm:ss,ms` (hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds) where `ms` is the milliseconds portion of the time.

Note that the code also includes a list of YouTube format codes for livestreams (`youtube_livestream_codes`) and MP4 formats (`youtube_mp4_codes`).

    return result.get("segments"), words, output_file 
 ```

The `get_text_from_mp3_whisper` function takes several arguments including `inputType`, `mp3_file`, `url_path`, `taskName`, and `srcLanguage`. It first removes any existing files with names `transcript.srt`, `temp.mp4`, and `subtitled.mp4`.

It then loads a pre-trained model from `whisper` using the `load_model` function. The function checks the value of `inputType` to determine whether to transcribe a local mp3 file (`mp3_file`) or a video at a remote URL (`url_path`). If `inputType` is `"url"`, it downloads the video from the remote URL using the `get_all_files` function and transcribes it. If `inputType` is `"file"`, it transcribes the local mp3 file.

The transcribed segments are then saved to a file named `transcript.srt`. The function then attempts to add subtitles to the video by overlaying the saved SRT file onto a copy of the video file. The resulting file is saved as `subtitled.mp4`. If the overlaying process fails, it saves the resulting file as `temp.mp4`.

The function then returns the segments and the contents of the SRT file as a string, as well as the name of the resulting video file.


```python 
 gr.Interface(
    title = 'Download Video From url and extract text from audio', 
    fn=get_text_from_mp3_whisper, 
    inputs=[
        gr.Dropdown(["url", "file"], value="url"),
        gr.inputs.Audio(type="filepath"),
        gr.inputs.Textbox(),
        gr.Dropdown(["translate", "transcribe"], value="translate"),
        gr.Dropdown(["Japanese", "English"], value="Japanese")
    ],
    button_text="Go!",
    button_color="#333333",
    outputs=[
        "json", "text", "file"
    ], 
 ```

It seems that the code block is not complete, as there is no closing parenthesis for the `gr.Interface` function call. However, assuming that the rest of the code is present, this function call creates a user interface using the `gradio` library.

The interface has a title, "Download Video From url and extract text from audio", and it takes in the following inputs:

1. A dropdown menu to select the input type ("url" or "file").
2. An audio input to upload an audio file.
3. A textbox to enter the URL of a video.
4. A dropdown menu to select the task ("translate" or "transcribe").
5. A dropdown menu to select the source language ("Japanese" or "English").

The interface also has a button with text "Go!" and color "#333333", and it outputs a JSON object, a string of text, and a file.


Using AI to transcribe videos has many practical benefits. Firstly, it enables the creation of accurate, searchable and accessible transcripts that can be used for a variety of purposes. Transcripts can be used to help people with hearing impairments to understand video content, as well as to provide captions and subtitles for non-native speakers of the video's language. Transcripts can also be used to provide metadata for video content, making it easier to search and categorize. Additionally, transcripts can be used to analyze the content of video content, allowing for more effective search and retrieval of relevant information.

AI-based transcription is also faster and more cost-effective than traditional human transcription methods. With the advances in AI technology, transcription can be done much faster and at a lower cost than hiring human transcribers. This allows for more content to be transcribed in a shorter amount of time, and at a lower cost. Furthermore, AI-based transcription can be easily scaled up or down depending on the size of the content that needs to be transcribed.

Overall, using AI to transcribe videos is a useful and practical application of AI technology that has the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and usability of video content.

## Scrapping Superbowl results with pandas

The Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League (NFL), which is played annually to determine the winner of the NFL season. The game is played on the first Sunday in February and is considered the biggest sporting event in the United States, attracting millions of viewers each year. The Super Bowl is also one of the largest events in the world of advertising, with many of the most expensive and highly-anticipated commercials airing during the broadcast. In addition to the game itself, the Super Bowl weekend has become a major cultural event, with parties, concerts, and other festivities taking place in the host city leading up to the game.


```python 
 import requests
import pandas
import matplotlib


# read pandas dataframe from url

base_url = 'http://www.espn.com/nfl/history'
leaders_df = pandas.read_html(f"{base_url}/leaders", attrs={'class': 'tablehead'})[0]


winners_df = pandas.read_html(f"http://www.espn.com/nfl/superbowl/history/winners", attrs={'class': 'tablehead'})[0]


mvp_df = pandas.read_html("http://www.espn.com/nfl/superbowl/history/mvps", attrs={'class': 'tablehead'})[0]


print(leaders_df.head())
print(winners_df.head())
print(mvp_df.head()) 
 ```

This code uses the `requests`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` libraries to retrieve and process data from three different URLs related to NFL history and the Super Bowl.

The first URL is for NFL leaders and the data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame called `leaders_df`. The second URL is for Super Bowl winners and the data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame called `winners_df`. The third URL is for Super Bowl MVPs and the data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame called `mvp_df`.

Finally, the code prints the first five rows of each DataFrame using the `head()` method of pandas DataFrames, which returns the first n (in this case, n=5) rows of the DataFrame.


```python 
                    0                    1                  2
0  Touchdown Leaders    Touchdown Leaders  Touchdown Leaders

2                  1           Jerry Rice                208
3                  2         Emmitt Smith                175
4                  3  LaDainian Tomlinson                162
                                0  ...                               3
0  Super Bowl Winners and Results  ...  Super Bowl Winners and Results
1                             NO.  ...                          RESULT
2                               I  ...    Green Bay 35, Kansas City 10
3                              II  ...        Green Bay 33, Oakland 14
4                             III  ...   New York Jets 16, Baltimore 7

[5 rows x 4 columns]
                                  0  ...                                 2
0  Super Bowl Most Valuable Players  ...  Super Bowl Most Valuable Players
1                               NO.  ...                        HIGHLIGHTS
2                                 I  ...              Two touchdown passes
3                                II  ...           202 yards passing, 1 TD
4                               III  ...                 206 yards passing 
 ```

These are the first five rows of each of the three pandas DataFrames that were created from the URLs related to NFL history and the Super Bowl.

The first DataFrame, `leaders_df`, shows the NFL touchdown leaders, including the rank, player name, and number of touchdowns scored.

The second DataFrame, `winners_df`, shows the results of each Super Bowl game, including the number of the Super Bowl, the winning team, and the result.

The third DataFrame, `mvp_df`, shows the most valuable player of each Super Bowl, including the number of the Super Bowl, the player's name, and highlights of their performance.


```python 
 # grab 4th column
# pandas drop first row of winners_df and change column names
# save winners_df to csv
winners_df.to_csv('winners_raw.csv', index=False)
winners_df = winners_df.iloc[1:]
winners_df.columns = winners_df.iloc[0]
winners_df = winners_df.iloc[1:]
print(winners_df.columns)
winners_df.to_csv('winners.csv', index=False)
print(winners_df.head())

sites_of_superbowl = winners_df['SITE'].unique()

print(sites_of_superbowl)
# for date column find the number of instances of Orange Bowl and plot it
# adjust all site to drop content in () and save to csv

winners_df_adjusted = winners_df.copy()
winners_df_adjusted['SITE'] = winners_df_adjusted['SITE'].str.replace(r'\(.*\)', '')
fig =  winners_df_adjusted.groupby('SITE').size().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 18)).get_figure() 
```

This code continues processing the `winners_df` DataFrame, which contains information about the results of each Super Bowl game.

The 4th column of `winners_df` is not grabbed because the code does not contain any specific instructions to do so.

The first row of `winners_df` is dropped using the `iloc` method and the remaining rows are set as the new column names using the `columns` attribute. This DataFrame is then saved to a new CSV file called 'winners.csv' using the `to_csv` method of pandas DataFrames.

Next, the code uses the `unique` method of pandas Series to get the unique values of the 'SITE' column and store the result in a variable called `sites_of_superbowl`.

Then, a new DataFrame called `winners_df_adjusted` is created as a copy of `winners_df` and the 'SITE' column is adjusted to remove the content in parentheses using the `str.replace` method of pandas Series.

Finally, the code uses the `groupby` method of pandas DataFrames to group the DataFrame by the 'SITE' column and the `size` method to get the size of each group. The resulting pandas Series is plotted using the `plot` method with the `kind` argument set to 'bar' and the `figsize` argument set to (10, 18). The figure object is stored in a variable called `fig`.


```python 
 Index(['NO.', 'DATE', 'SITE', 'RESULT'], dtype='object', name=1)
1  NO.  ...                         RESULT
2    I  ...   Green Bay 35, Kansas City 10
3   II  ...       Green Bay 33, Oakland 14
4  III  ...  New York Jets 16, Baltimore 7
5   IV  ...    Kansas City 23, Minnesota 7
6    V  ...        Baltimore 16, Dallas 13

[5 rows x 4 columns]
['Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum' 'Orange Bowl (Miami)'
 'Tulane Stadium (New Orleans)' 'Rice Stadium (Houston)'
 'Rose Bowl (Pasadena, Calif.)' 'Superdome (New Orleans)'
 'Silverdome (Pontiac, Mich.)' 'Tampa (Fla.) Stadium'
 'Stanford (Calif.) Stadium' 'Jack Murphy Stadium (San Diego)'
 'Joe Robbie Stadium (Miami)' 'Metrodome (Minneapolis)'
 'Georgia Dome (Atlanta)' 'Sun Devil Stadium (Tempe, Ariz.)'
 'Qualcomm Stadium (San Diego)' 'Pro Player Stadium (Miami)'
 'Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Fla.)' 'Reliant Stadium (Houston)'
 'Alltel Stadium (Jacksonville, Fla.)' 'Ford Field (Detroit)'
 'Dolphin Stadium (Miami)'
 'University of Phoenix Stadium (Glendale, Ariz.)'
 'Sun Life Stadium (Miami)' 'Cowboys Stadium (Arlington, Texas)'
 'Lucas Oil Stadium (Indianapolis)'
 'Mercedes-Benz Superdome (New Orleans)'
 'MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford, N.J.)'
 "Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, Calif.)" 'NRG Stadium (Houston)'
 'U.S. Bank Stadium (Minneapolis)' 'Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta)'
 'Hard Rock Stadium (Miami)' 'SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, Calif.)' 
 ```

The code above uses the `pandas` library to scrape data about the NFL Super Bowl winners, MVPs, and touchdown leaders from the ESPN website. It then saves the data in CSV format for future use.

It starts by reading the HTML tables from the website using the `read_html` method from the `pandas` library and storing the results in dataframes. The first dataframe, `leaders_df`, contains the touchdown leaders. The second dataframe, `winners_df`, contains the Super Bowl winners and results. The third dataframe, `mvp_df`, contains the Super Bowl MVPs.

The code then processes the `winners_df` dataframe to remove the first row and set the column names, which are the first row of the dataframe. The processed dataframe is then saved in a new CSV file called 'winners.csv'.

Next, the code extracts the unique values of the 'SITE' column of the `winners_df` dataframe and stores the results in the `sites_of_superbowl` array. The code then creates a new dataframe called `winners_df_adjusted` that is a copy of the `winners_df` dataframe but with the content in the parentheses removed from the 'SITE' column. Finally, the code plots a bar chart of the number of instances of each site using the `groupby` and `size` methods from the `pandas` library and the `plot` method from the `matplotlib` library.


![football graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FriendlyUser/data-science-projects/main/superbowl/winners.png)
Yes, indeed! Web scraping is a powerful tool to collect data from websites and the combination with data visualization makes it even more valuable to understand and draw insights from the data. It's also a great way to automate data collection and analysis tasks.

## Getting youtube livestream status

YouTube is a video-sharing website where users can upload, share, and view videos. It was founded in February 2005 and later acquired by Google in November 2006. It has since become one of the largest and most popular websites on the internet, offering a wide variety of content, including music videos, educational videos, movie trailers, and more. Users can also interact with each other by commenting on videos, giving "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" ratings, and subscribing to other users' channels. YouTube is available on various devices, including computers, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Transcribing Federal Reserve livestreams in real time is important for investors because the statements made by Federal Reserve officials can have a significant impact on financial markets. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, and its policies and statements on monetary policy, economic conditions, and interest rates can have a major effect on the stock market, the bond market, and the value of the US dollar.

By transcribing the livestreams in real time, investors can quickly and accurately obtain information and insights from the Federal Reserve's statements. This can help them make informed investment decisions and respond to market changes as they occur. Additionally, real-time transcription allows investors to more effectively analyze and interpret the Federal Reserve's statements, giving them a competitive advantage in a fast-paced and constantly-changing market.

In short, transcribing Federal Reserve livestreams in real time is important for investors because it allows them to stay up-to-date on the central bank's statements and respond quickly to market changes, which can have a significant impact on their investments.

This code uses the BeautifulSoup library and Selenium WebDriver to scrape a YouTube channel for live stream data. The function `get_livestreams_from_html` takes in an HTML string as input and returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a live stream event.

The function first creates a BeautifulSoup object from the input HTML string and then searches the HTML tree for specific elements that contain information about the live streams. It checks if the live stream is currently happening or if it's scheduled to happen in the future, and if it's live, it checks if it's never ending. If the live stream is never ending, the function does not include that event in the list of live streams.

The function uses the dateparser library to parse dates from strings, such as "August 22 at 6:00 AM". The live stream events are returned as a list of dictionaries, each containing the date and time of the event, the channel name, and the status of the event (live or upcoming).

This code can be used as a starting point for a more comprehensive script that scrapes live streams from YouTube, but it may need to be adapted to fit the specific needs of the user.


```python 
 
def get_webdriver():
    remote_url = os.environ.get("REMOTE_SELENIUM_URL")
    if remote_url is None:
        raise Exception("Missing REMOTE_SELENIUM_URL in env vars")
    return webdriver.Remote(
        command_executor=remote_url,
    )

def get_html_from_url(url: str):
    """
        gets html from url
    """
    # get text data from url using requests
    driver = get_webdriver()
    driver.get(url)
    time.sleep(10)
    # return html from page source
    return driver.page_source

if __name__ == "__main__":
    html = get_html_from_url("https://www.youtube.com/c/YahooFinance")
    livestream_data = get_livestreams_from_html(html)

    base_url = "https://www.youtube.com"
    # check if LIVE or UPCOMING
    for livestream in livestream_data:
        if livestream["status"] == "LIVE":
            print("LIVE")
            youtube_url = base_url + livestream["watch_url"]
            data = {"youtube_url": youtube_url, "iteration": -1, "table_name": "YahooFinance"}
            print(data)
        elif livestream["status"] == "UPCOMING":
            print("UPCOMING")
            exit(0)
        else:
            print("NONE")
            exit(1) 
 ```

This code is using the Selenium WebDriver to automate the web browser and retrieve the HTML content of a YouTube channel. The channel URL is hardcoded as "<https://www.youtube.com/c/YahooFinance>" in the `get_html_from_url` function, but it could be updated to read from a configuration file, as noted in the TODO comment.

After retrieving the HTML, the code uses the `get_livestreams_from_html` function to extract information about the livestreams on the channel, if any. It then checks the status of each livestream, and if the status is "LIVE", it prints the information, including the URL of the livestream on YouTube and some additional data. If the status is "UPCOMING", the code exits with status code 0. If the status is neither "LIVE" nor "UPCOMING", the code exits with status code 1.

## Natural gas Analysis 

Gas prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including changes in the cost of crude oil, which is the primary raw material used to produce gasoline, as well as changes in supply and demand for gasoline, taxes, and other costs associated with refining, storing, and transporting gasoline. Additionally, geopolitical events, such as conflicts or natural disasters, can also affect gas prices by disrupting the global oil market.


Cyclical stocks are stocks that tend to be sensitive to the economic cycle, meaning their prices tend to rise and fall with the overall health of the economy. These stocks are often associated with industries that are heavily influenced by consumer spending, such as retail, consumer durables, and homebuilding.

Cyclical stocks tend to perform well during economic expansions and periods of low unemployment, as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential goods and services. However, during economic downturns and recessions, when consumer spending decreases, the profits and stock prices of companies in cyclical industries tend to decline.

Examples of cyclical stocks include those in the automotive, construction, housing, and consumer discretionary sectors.


A 3-month moving average is a technical indicator that is used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in a stock or index's price, and to help identify longer-term trends. It is calculated by taking the average of a stock or index's closing price over the past three months.

The idea behind a moving average is that it helps to filter out "noise" in the stock or index's price, and to make it easier to spot trends. By averaging out the closing prices over a longer period of time, such as three months, the moving average smooths out any short-term volatility in the stock or index's price, and makes it easier to identify longer-term trends.

Traders often use moving averages to help identify buy and sell signals. For example, if a stock or index's price is above its 3-month moving average, it may be considered to be in an uptrend, and traders may buy the stock or index. Conversely, if a stock or index's price is below its 3-month moving average, it may be considered to be in a downtrend, and traders may sell the stock or index.


```python 
 # calculate average from daily data from natural gas futures from yahoo finance
import yfinance
import pandas as pd
import mplfinance as mpf

# read NG=F 2 years worth of data

nat_gas = yfinance.download("NG=F", start="2021-01-01", end="2023-01-01")

nat_gas['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(nat_gas.index)
# pad all date
# print(nat_gas.groupby(by=['Volume', 'Adj Close', pd.Grouper(key='Month', freq='3M')])['Open'].agg('mean'))

mths_3 = pd.date_range(end = nat_gas.index[-1], freq=pd.offsets.BQuarterEnd(),periods=8)
# mths_6 = pd.date_range(end = nat_gas.index[-1], freq=pd.offsets.MonthBegin(6),periods=4)

mth3 = (nat_gas
         #filter for last three months
        .loc[mths_3]
        .groupby(["Month", "Volume"])
        .agg(avg_ng_last_3_months=("Open","mean"))
        )

# considering the investor presentation, thinking its closer to 360M revenue and 160 M profit.
quarterly_profit = 160
# 	266.05M * 0.2
# if deliveries are 3 quarters behind then 


quarterly_dividend = 266.05 * 0.2
print(quarterly_dividend)

remaining_revenue = quarterly_profit - quarterly_dividend
print(remaining_revenue)
# 176 debt
total_debt = 176

# max debt reduction (they target to get to 50M USD in debt)
min_debt_reduction = total_debt - 100

This script appears to be using the yfinance library to download historical data for natural gas futures (NG=F) from Yahoo Finance, for the period between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2023. It then uses the Pandas library to create a new column in the dataframe called "Month" which is populated with the date of the data point, and converts it to a datetime object.

It then uses the Pandas library to create a date range for the last 8 quarters, and filters the dataframe to only include data points from those quarters. It then groups the data by the "Month" column and the "Volume" column, and calculates the average "Open" value for each group, which it saves to a new column in the dataframe called "avg\_ng\_last\_3\_months".

It also appears to be doing some calculations related to a company's profit, dividend, and debt, but it's not clear how these calculations relate to the data being downloaded or how they are being used.

After that it is using mplfinance library to plot Open high low and close prices of natural gas with 30, 60 and 90 moving averages, and volume, and then it's saving the graph with the name ng.png.


There are several libraries in Python that can be used to create financial plots, including:

* Matplotlib: A widely-used library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It can be used to create a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and candlestick plots.
* Plotly: A library for creating interactive visualizations in Python. It can be used to create a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and candlestick plots.
* mplfinance: A library built on top of matplotlib that is specifically designed for financial plotting. It can be used to create a wide variety of financial plots, including candlestick plots, barcharts and volume plots.
* seaborn: A library for creating statistical visualizations in Python. It can be used to create a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and heatmaps.
* bokeh: A library for creating interactive visualizations in Python. It can be used to create a wide variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and candlestick plots.

All of these libraries have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on the specific needs of the project. Some are better for creating static plots, while others are better for creating interactive visualizations. Some are better for working with large datasets, while others are better for creating highly customized visualizations.

Most of the libraries mentioned above require a basic understanding of the plotting and visualization concepts, Some of the libraries like mplfinance are built on top of matplotlib and are more specialized to financial plots, making it easier to create charts like candlestick charts and other financial plots.


Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on gas consumption as the world shifts towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more extreme, the demand for natural gas is expected to increase in certain sectors such as power generation, as it is considered a cleaner alternative to coal and oil. However, in other sectors such as transportation, the demand for natural gas may decrease as electric vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles become more prevalent.

The use of natural gas for power generation is expected to increase as countries look to phase out coal and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Natural gas is a less carbon-intensive fossil fuel and can be used in combination with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power to provide a flexible and reliable source of electricity.

However, the transportation sector is also a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is a growing movement to shift away from fossil fuels and towards electric and alternative fuel vehicles. As a result, the demand for natural gas as a transportation fuel is expected to decrease in the long term.

Overall, the impact of climate change on gas consumption is complex and will depend on a variety of factors, including government policies, technological advancements, and consumer preferences. It's important to note that natural gas can be used as a transition fuel to decrease the use of coal and oil in power production and make the transition to renewable energy sources.
